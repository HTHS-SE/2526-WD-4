    <p class="about">In the TRUE PACIFIST Timeline, you cannot kill anything. If you do, you are unable to complete the timeline.
      Throughout the game, you also have to go on dates with certain characters. Many people have also called this 
      route the cannon/true ending to UNDERTALE.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="about" >
      Since the Neutral Timeline still occurs during the Pacifist Run, we have included the Neutral timeline. There is 
      some extra information on how to complete the route correctly. If you would like to skip the Neurtal Timeline,

                  Flowey. Toriel then shows the HUMAN around, acting as a caregiver to them. Toriel is also the first main battle

                  whom they took in as their own. The HUMAN fell ill one day, and Asriel decided to bring their body back up
