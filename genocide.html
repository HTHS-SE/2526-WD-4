      <p class="about">In the TRUE PACIFIST Timeline, you cannot kill anything. If you do, you are unable to complete the timeline.
        Throughout the game, you also have to go on dates with certain characters. Many people have also called this 
        route the canon/true ending to UNDERTALE.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="about">
        Since the Neutral Timeline still occurs during the Pacifist Run, we have included the Neutral timeline. There is 
        some extra information on how to complete the route correctly. If you would like to skip the Neutral Timeline, 
        please click this button.

                    Flowey. Toriel then shows the HUMAN around, acting as a caregiver to them. Toriel is also the first main battle
                    that the HUMAN must fight. It's very important to kill everyone in the RUINS. The moment the HUMAN gets the 
                    text 'But nobody came...', everyone in that section is dead. When it comes to Toriel's battle, the HUMAN kills 
                    her in one go.

                    by attacking them, making him the second boss fight the HUMAN encounters. Once again, the HUMAN must kill 
                    everyone in this section. Once Papyrus is killed in one hit, Sans won't appear again.

                    were married, and they had a child together. One day, a HUMAN fell into the underground
                    whom they took in as their own. The HUMAN fell ill one day, and Asriel decided to bring their body back up
                    as it was their final wish. However, the humans above thought Asriel killed the HUMAN, so they killed Asriel.
                    From then on, Asgore decided that any human who falls down must be killed. Therefore, Toriel divorced him. The 
                    TRUE HOME was their first home. At the end of the story, Flowey expresses that he is afraid of the HUMAN.
