            <p class="culture-text">Since its release in 2015, <em>Undertale</em> has sold millions of copies and made a lasting impact on the indie video game scene.
                Created primarily by Toby Fox, the game quickly developed a dedicated fanbase with its unique humor and message.

                <h3>CHOOSING MERCY</h1>
                <p class="lead culture-text">
                    Unlike most video games, <em>Undertale</em> gives players the option to fight enemies or peacefully settle issues with them. 
                    Toby Fox has cited <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>, another video game with a similar conflict resolution style, as an inspiration. 
                    The game’s <a href="story.html">branching timelines</a> show the player the impact of their actions and the value of choosing 
                    peace over war. <em>Undertale</em>'s special <a href="mech.html">mechanics</a> help communicate a theme of non-violence rarely seen in video games, 
                    which often have the goal of beating enemies without regard for their fates.

                <p class="lead culture-text">
                    <em>Undertale</em> has built its reputation as a classic among video game lovers. Its meaningful plot and moving scenes 
                    are remembered and cherished by players all over the world. <em>Undertale</em> has appeared in countless memes – one of its 
                    <a href="music.html">songs</a>, MEGALOVANIA, is particularly notorious, and the <a href="characters.html">character</a> Sans 
                    is instantly recognizable to players and non-players alike. 
                    The game has grown a mostly young online fanbase that, even years after its release, continues to celebrate it.

                <h3>UNDERTALE'S LEGACY</h3>
                <p class="lead culture-text">
                    <em>Undertale</em> holds a special place in the hearts of many and has changed how millions view video games. 
                    Although video games are often thought of as purely for entertainment, <em>Undertale</em>’s format as a role-player game 
                    where the player controls their destiny has allowed it to connect more deeply with players and make its message for peace 
                    even more powerful. In 2018, Toby Fox followed up with the release of <em>Deltarune</em>, a game set in an alternate universe 
                    to that of <em>Undertale</em> that features some of its characters. <em>Deltarune</em> also makes commentary on the use of 
                    violence, except it focuses on the acceptable use of violence in the face of oppression.
